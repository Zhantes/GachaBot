GachaBot

This is a project in order to improve my programming skills, while at the same time doing something that might be fun or interesting. The objective is to create a discord bot that is accurately able to simulate a gacha system, popular in many games these days. 

The first version will be a simple python script that will roll a random number, and depending on the result, decide on whether it will return a B-rank, A-rank or S-rank result. Later versions will include discord integration in the form of a bot, and possibly also include other systems, such as tokens to be used for pulls, a pity system, and a role given to those depending on what they pull.

The rates will be based on the game Zenless Zone Zero, as it's the only gacha game I'm playing at the moment, so I can consult the rates, which are displayed below:

S-rank: 0.6%

A-rank: 9.4%

B-rank: 90%
