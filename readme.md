GachaBot

This is a project in order to improve my programming skills, while at the same time doing something that might be fun or interesting. The objective is to create a discord bot that is accurately able to simulate a gacha system, popular in many games these days. 

Currently the bot can be added to any discord server, where users can do "pulLs" with the /pull command, which will then lead the bot into picking one of 3 rarities, B, A, and S, and return a message with which rarity they got. There's also a /10pull command, which does 10 consecutive pulls, and returns the results in a list to the user over discord. Finally, there is an /info command that allows the user to consult rates, pity, the available commands and total # of attempts (which is used to calculate pity).

Future planned additions:

- Individual pity tracker for A-rank and S-rank, allowing the user to know how much pity they have for each.

- "Token" system, where users are only able to use the /pull and /10pull commands if they have enough tokens. Tokens can be gained through other systems and given to users by admin-specific slash commands.

- Individual character tracker, this is a gacha after all! Allow for the main gacha system to pick a character from a database to be displayed in the output, and also granted to the user, so that they can collect different characters.
